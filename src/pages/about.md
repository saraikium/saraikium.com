## About Me

Greetings! I'm Adnan Akbar Khan, a dedicated Full-Stack Developer with a passion for crafting seamless and innovative web solutions. My journey in the realm of technology has been fueled by a combination of JavaScript and Python wizardry, focusing on creating modern single-page applications using React, REST APIs, and NodeJS.

## My Expertise:

As a seasoned developer, I've had the privilege of leading the charge at MOST, where I function as a Tech Lead in both frontend and backend development. I played a pivotal role in establishing the frontend architecture and excelled as a solo backend developer using Python and Flask. Notable achievements include significantly improving API response times, reducing them from 10+ seconds to less than a second.

## Tech Arsenal:

JavaScript, ES6+, React, React Hooks, NodeJS, RESTful APIs, Python, Flask, PostgreSQL.
